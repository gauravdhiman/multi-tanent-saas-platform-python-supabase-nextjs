# Billing System Implementation Summary

## 🎯 Implementation Complete

We have successfully implemented a comprehensive billing system for the multi-tenant SaaS platform with Stripe integration. Here's what has been delivered:

## 📊 Database Schema (Alembic Migration)

**File:** `backend/alembic/versions/b1c2d3e4f5g6_add_billing_and_subscription_tables.py`

### New Tables Created:
- **subscription_plans** - Available subscription tiers with pricing and features
- **organization_subscriptions** - Organization subscription status and lifecycle  
- **credit_events** - Configurable events that consume credits
- **credit_transactions** - Complete audit trail of all credit movements
- **credit_products** - Standalone credit packages for purchase
- **billing_history** - Payment history and invoice tracking

### Key Features:
✅ Multi-interval support (monthly/annual)  
✅ Credit expiry management (subscription vs purchased credits)  
✅ Comprehensive indexing for performance  
✅ Row Level Security (RLS) enabled  
✅ Default seed data for testing  

## 🚀 Backend Implementation

### Core Services

**1. Stripe Service** (`backend/src/billing/stripe_service.py`)
- Customer management
- Subscription lifecycle
- Payment processing
- Checkout sessions
- Customer portal
- Webhook verification

**2. Billing Service** (`backend/src/billing/service.py`)
- Credit management with precedence rules
- Subscription business logic
- Usage tracking and consumption
- Comprehensive billing summaries
- Credit allocation and expiry

**3. Webhook Handler** (`backend/src/billing/webhook_handler.py`)
- Event-driven subscription updates
- Automatic credit allocation
- Payment status synchronization
- Error handling and retry logic

### API Endpoints (`backend/src/billing/routes.py`)

**Subscription Management:**
- `GET /api/billing/plans` - List available plans
- `POST /api/billing/subscription/checkout` - Create subscription
- `GET /api/billing/subscription/{org_id}` - Get subscription details
- `POST /api/billing/subscription/portal` - Access customer portal

**Credit Management:**
- `GET /api/billing/credits/{org_id}` - Get credit balance
- `POST /api/billing/credits/consume` - Consume credits
- `GET /api/billing/credit-products` - List credit packages
- `POST /api/billing/credit-products/checkout` - Purchase credits

**Billing Information:**
- `GET /api/billing/summary/{org_id}` - Comprehensive billing summary
- `GET /api/billing/history/{org_id}` - Billing transaction history
- `POST /api/billing/webhook/stripe` - Stripe webhook endpoint

## 🎨 Frontend Implementation

### Enhanced Billing Dashboard (`frontend/src/app/(dashboard)/billing/page.tsx`)

**Features Implemented:**
✅ **Overview Tab** - Current subscription status and usage stats  
✅ **Plans Tab** - Interactive plan comparison and upgrade interface  
✅ **Credits Tab** - Credit balance, alerts, and purchase options  
✅ **History Tab** - Complete billing transaction history  

**Real-time Data Integration:**
- Live subscription status display
- Credit balance tracking
- Usage monitoring
- Payment history with receipt/invoice links

### Service Layer (`frontend/src/services/billing-service.ts`)
- Complete API integration
- Stripe checkout handling
- Data formatting utilities
- Error handling and user feedback

### Type Definitions (`frontend/src/types/billing.ts`)
- Comprehensive TypeScript interfaces
- Utility functions for formatting
- Status enumerations and helpers

## 🔧 Configuration Updates

### Environment Variables (`backend/.env.example`)
```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_...
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_...
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_...
```

### Dependencies (`backend/requirements.txt`)
- Added `stripe==10.15.0` for payment processing

### Application Integration (`backend/main.py`)
- Billing routes integrated into FastAPI application

## 💳 Credit System Architecture

### Credit Types & Precedence
1. **Purchased Credits** (no expiry) - consumed first
2. **Subscription Credits** (expire at period end) - consumed second

### Configurable Events
```sql
-- Example credit events
api_call_basic: 1 credit
api_call_premium: 5 credits  
storage_gb_month: 10 credits
ai_inference: 25 credits
```

### Smart Consumption Logic
- Automatic precedence handling
- Real-time balance updates
- Comprehensive transaction logging
- Usage analytics and reporting

## 🔄 Subscription Lifecycle

### Status Management
- **Trial** → **Active** → **Past Due** → **Cancelled/Expired**
- Webhook-driven status updates
- Automatic credit allocation on renewal
- Grace period handling for failed payments

### Stripe Integration
- Secure webhook verification
- Automatic customer creation
- Subscription synchronization
- Payment retry logic

## 🛡️ Security & Performance

### Security Features
✅ Row Level Security (RLS) on all tables  
✅ Webhook signature verification  
✅ Organization-scoped data access  
✅ Comprehensive audit trails  

### Performance Optimizations
✅ Strategic database indexing  
✅ Efficient query patterns  
✅ Background webhook processing  
✅ Caching-friendly data structures  

## 📈 Monitoring & Analytics

### Key Metrics Tracked
- Subscription health and churn
- Credit consumption patterns
- Payment success rates

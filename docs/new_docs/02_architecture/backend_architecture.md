# Backend Architecture Overview

This document provides an overview of the backend architecture of the multi-tenant SaaS platform.

## Core Components

-   **FastAPI**: The web framework used for building the API.
-   **SQLAlchemy**: ORM for database interactions.
-   **PostgreSQL**: The primary database for storing application data.
-   **Supabase**: Used for authentication and real-time subscriptions.
-   **Alembic**: Database migration tool.
-   **Celery**: Asynchronous task queue for background jobs.
-   **Redis**: Message broker for Celery and caching.

## Module Structure

The backend is organized into several modules, each responsible for a specific domain:

-   **`auth`**: Handles user authentication, authorization, and RBAC.
-   **`billing`**: Manages subscription plans, payments, and credit system.
-   **`organizations`**: Manages tenant (organization) related data and operations.
-   **`users`**: Manages user profiles and roles within organizations.
-   **`core`**: Contains common utilities, configurations, and base models.

## API Design

-   **RESTful Principles**: APIs are designed following REST principles.
-   **Versioning**: API versioning is handled through URL prefixes (e.g., `/api/v1`).
-   **Authentication**: JWT-based authentication using Supabase.
-   **Authorization**: Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) is enforced for all sensitive endpoints.

## Data Flow

1.  **Client Request**: Frontend sends requests to the FastAPI backend.
2.  **Authentication/Authorization**: Middleware verifies JWT token and user permissions.
3.  **Service Layer**: Business logic is executed, interacting with the database and other services.
4.  **Database Interaction**: SQLAlchemy ORM is used to interact with PostgreSQL.
5.  **Response**: Backend sends a JSON response back to the frontend.

## Asynchronous Tasks

-   **Celery**: Used for long-running tasks such as email notifications, data processing, and report generation.
-   **Redis**: Serves as the message broker for Celery.

## Deployment

-   **Docker**: The backend application is containerized using Docker.
-   **Kubernetes/Cloud Run**: Deployed on container orchestration platforms.

## Security Considerations

-   **Row Level Security (RLS)**: Implemented in PostgreSQL for multi-tenancy.
-   **Input Validation**: Pydantic models are used for request and response validation.
-   **Environment Variables**: Sensitive information is stored in environment variables.
-   **Rate Limiting**: Implemented to prevent abuse.

## Future Enhancements

-   **GraphQL API**: Explore adding a GraphQL endpoint for more flexible data fetching.
-   **Microservices**: Break down monolithic services into smaller microservices for better scalability.
-   **Advanced Caching**: Implement more sophisticated caching strategies.
